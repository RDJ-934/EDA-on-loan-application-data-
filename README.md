# EDA-on-loan-application-data
This is a miniproject created by me for performing EDA on Loan application dataset CSV file.
EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help determine if the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate. Using this I derived various conclusions regarding my data by plotting various graphs using Matplotlib and seaborn. It was kinda fun to do analysis of the data.
